# predict-oil-prices-using-30-years-
In this project, I applied machine learning techniques to predict oil prices using 30 years of weekly Brent oil price data. I experimented with multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Stacking, optimizing the models through hyperparameter tuning to improve prediction accuracy.
